`ISDSConsumer` extends `ScheduledPollConsumer`.
This means that you can use
http://camel.apache.org/polling-consumer.html#PollingConsumer-ScheduledPollConsumerOptions[ScheduledPollConsumerOptions]
with prefix `consumer.`

For example to set polling period to 72 hours, you can use:
```java
from("isds:?environment=test&username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD&consumer.delay=72h")
		.log("new message ${body}");
```
