| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

Consumer Endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`ISDSConsumer` extends `ScheduledPollConsumer`.
This means that you can use
http://camel.apache.org/polling-consumer.html#PollingConsumer-ScheduledPollConsumerOptions[ScheduledPollConsumerOptions]
with prefix `consumer.`

For example to set polling period to 72 hours, you can use:
```java
from("isds:fetch?environment=test&username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD&consumer.delay=72h")
		.log("new message ${body}");
```
